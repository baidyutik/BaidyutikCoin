# Decentralized Social Network
Decentralized Social Network is a concept that has been proposed by many people in the blockchain space, but no one has yet implemented it.

The idea is to create a social network where users control their own data, instead of having it controlled by a central authority like Facebook or Twitter. 

With the rise of social media and the internet, it has become easier to share photos, videos and other content with friends and family. However, there are several issues that have arisen with centralized social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. These include censorship, data mining and privacy concerns.

A decentralized social network is a platform that can be used to connect with others in a decentralized manner. This means that you don't have to rely on a centralized company to store your data or provide the infrastructure needed to host a website. Instead, all of these services are provided by peers on the network itself and should be available without relying on any one person or company.

In this network everyone can share whatever they want except: Porn, Nudity and other hateful activity will be pre blocked on the network.
In this network your account will never be blocked or deleted.
No one will collect your data and sell it to others, your data is only yours.
